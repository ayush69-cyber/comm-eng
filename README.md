**Slide 1: Introduction**
"Good morning everyone! My name is Ayush Khanal, and today I will be talking about the teaching style in Nepal. Education plays a crucial role in shaping the future of individuals and society. Over the years, Nepal’s education system has evolved significantly. In this presentation, I will walk you through traditional and modern teaching methods, the challenges we face, and the potential future of education in Nepal."

**Slide 2: Background/Context**
"Let’s start with some background. Historically, Nepal’s education system was based on the Gurukul system, where students lived with their teachers to learn various subjects. However, in the 1950s, formal schools and universities were established, bringing in structured education. Despite these advancements, many schools still rely on rote memorization and teacher-centric methods. Fortunately, recent reforms aim to make learning more interactive and student-centered."

**Slide 3: Key Teaching Methods in Nepal**
"Moving on to teaching methods. Traditionally, lecture-based learning has been dominant, especially in public schools. Exams focus on rote memorization rather than practical understanding. However, some private institutions have started incorporating interactive learning approaches, including discussions and problem-solving activities. Additionally, technology is gradually being introduced into classrooms, enhancing engagement and making learning more dynamic."

**Slide 4: Challenges in Teaching Methods**
"While education in Nepal is progressing, it still faces several challenges. Many rural schools lack modern teaching tools, making it difficult to provide quality education. Overcrowded classrooms limit teacher-student interactions, and insufficient teacher training results in ineffective teaching strategies. Additionally, there is a strong resistance to change among educators who are accustomed to traditional methods. Overcoming these barriers is crucial for improving the education system."

**Slide 5: Modern Innovations and Future Trends**
"Despite these challenges, Nepal is witnessing innovations in teaching. Digital learning platforms, such as online courses and educational apps, are being introduced. The government is implementing policies to promote experiential learning and better teacher training. Private schools are adopting international curricula with more interactive teaching techniques. Looking forward, integrating technology and research-based learning can help Nepal develop a more holistic and practical education system."

**Slide 6: Conclusion**
"To conclude, Nepal’s teaching style is transitioning from a rigid, rote-learning model to a more interactive and technology-driven approach. However, challenges such as limited resources and insufficient teacher training still need to be addressed. By embracing modern teaching methods and investing in quality education, we can create a more engaging and effective learning environment. What do you think are the best ways to innovate teaching in Nepal?"
